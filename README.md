# SafePKT Smart Contract Verification Example

This project is implemented in the context of the European [NGI LEDGER program](https://ledger-3rd-open-call.fundingbox.com/).

This project is based on a [Plain Multisig smart contract example](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/v2.1.0/examples/multisig_plain/lib.rs) from [ink! eDSL](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/v2.1.0),  
which depends on the substrate platform.  

Opening this project in a VS Code workspace enables developers and researchers
to verify the library-oriented program written in Rust with SafePKT tooking from a text editor.

# Acknowledgment

We're very grateful towards the following organizations, projects and people:
 - the Project Oak maintainers for making [Rust Verifications Tools](https://project-oak.github.io/rust-verification-tools/), a dual-licensed open-source project (MIT / Apache).  
 The RVT tools allowed us to integrate with industrial-grade verification tools in a very effective way. 
 - the KLEE Symbolic Execution Engine maintainers
 - the [Parity Technologies](https://github.com/paritytech) organization,  
 for [substrate platform](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) and [ink! eDSL](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) allowing us to write smart contract in Rust
 - the Rust community at large
 - All members of the NGI-Ledger Consortium for accompanying us
